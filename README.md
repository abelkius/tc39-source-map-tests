# Source Map Tests

This repository holds testing discussions and tests for the the Source Map debugging format. Specifically, we're looking to encourage discussion around:

- Manual and automated testing strategies for Source Maps
- Gathering a list of Soure Map generators and consumers
- General discussion around deviations between source maps

Open discussion happens in the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/source-map/source-map-tests/issues).

Source Map spec: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit?pli=1#

## Test cases

These test cases are still a work-in-progress ðŸš§.

How to run in Firefox:
  * Check out mozilla-unified (see [Firefox dev setup](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/index.html) under "Setting up your machine" for details, note that you can use git via [git-cinnabar](https://github.com/glandium/git-cinnabar/))
  * `cd` to the checked out directory.
  * Run `git am <this-repo>/firefox/0001-WIP-Firefox-source-map-spec-tests.patch`
  * Run `mach build` (this builds the test too, you'll need to run it if you modify tests/harness)
  * Run `mach test devtools/client/shared/source-map-loader/`

How to run in WebKit:
  * Check out [WebKit](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/)
  * `cd` to the checked out WebKit directory.
  * Run `git am <this-repo>/webkit/0001-Add-harness-for-source-maps-spec-tests.patch`
  * Run `Tools/Scripts/build-webkit` (depending on the platform you may need to pass `--gtk` or other flags)
  * Run `Tools/Scripts/run-webkit-tests LayoutTests/inspector/model/source-map-spec.html` (again, you may need `--gtk` on Linux)
